Hello, my name is Michael Nester. 
I am a student at The University of Rhode Island, studying computer science. 
I am originally from Rhode Island, but I started studying at the University of New Hampshire. 
After some thought, I decided that URI would better suit me. So far, it has been a very good decision as I enjoy the campus and my fellow students. 
Some of my hobbys are skateboarding and photography. I love taking pictures of the outdoors and videos of people skating.
                                                                                    
                                                                                          
                                                                                          </body>
                                                                                          </html>
