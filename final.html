                      My CSC 106 Final Project
                      </h1>
  <p>
                      For my final project, I worked with Luca Nero to create an adventure game. In this game, the player (you) must go around a map of tiles, looking for a treasure. 
                      You will run into obstacles along the way, and you must answer right or you lose a life, from your original 3 lives. To find the treasure, you must answer 4 questions
                      right. If you answer three questions wrong, you lose all of your lives and the game is over. To move the player, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Move slowly, 
                      because if you hit an obstacle and try to move again while the question screen is up, you will not be able to answer that question and this may result in being unable
                      to win or lose the game. Also, if you move off the map, you lose 1 life, so all the more reason to be careful where you move. After winning or losing, press "restart" 
                      in the khan terminal to play again.
